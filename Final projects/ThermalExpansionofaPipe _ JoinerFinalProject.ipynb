      "Greetings and welcome back.  This module will discuss the 2nd order equation governing the expansion of materials.  More specifically it will cover the linear thermal expansion of process piping.  Like many objects, metal pipes expand and contract due to variations in temperature.  This is especially true for process piping and if not careful this will lead to the pipe and pipe supports to become overly stressed.  For instance if a steam pipe containing 350 degrees Fahrenheit is installed on a 10 degree day, the pipe will expand considerably.  This expansion, if restrained will lead to a larger buildup of forces on the restraints.  How much will this pipe expand, unconstrained?  How much stress will be applied to the restraints?  Let\u2019s find out."
